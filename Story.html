First authenticated sighting of Unidentified Flying Objects, </br>
belonging to Them, at the edge of our galaxy.</br></br>

</br>January 24, 2040</br> Unexplainable meteor showers happen around the world.
</br></br>
</br>July 20, 2040 </br>
Crash site discovered in the northern section of New Canada.</br>
Videos go viral in 42 minutes. Western United Alliance refuses to share 
information with the United Nations of Earth.
</br></br>
</br>August 1, 2040</br>
Alien life forms present themselves to the world via every screened electrical </br>
device on earth. Even screens with no viable power source or speaker system relay message.</br>
"We come in...peace. We are *hesitation* the...United....Spacian...Monarchy.</br>
Our remote ship detected life on this...bio-sphere before crashing due to...mechanized failure. We have...converted your...language from electronic transmissions. We wish to retrieve our equipment."
</br></br>
</br>August 2, 2040 </br> UNE demands the return of the ship to the USM as a show of good faith. WUA refuses until it can be studied by their own scientists.
</br></br>
</br>September 11, 2040 </br> UNE signs peace treaty with USM ambassador, declaring they will assist the USM in getting their ship back by any means necessary.
</br></br>
</br>October 31, 2040 </br> Alien population in London, South England estimated at 100,000. Having seen records of the holiday "Halloween," they dress up in human-face and go around asking for energy. Once it is discovered what they are doing they are given candy, however they seem disappointed and give it back to the human children.
</br></br>
</br>February 17, 2041 </br> UNE declares war on WUA after peace talks and trade agreements fall through.
</br></br>
</br>June 20, 2042 </br> It's noticably cooler worldwide. The war continues on. Despite many attempts no information is found on the space craft's location.
</br></br>
</br>December 24, 2042 </br> UNE scientists discover sun is outputting a record low amount of energy, leading to even further drops in global temperature.
</br></br>
</br>January 10, 2043 </br> WUA engineers broadcast their discovery to the world the same way the aliens did over two years ago. The aliens have not come in peace. They are syphoning the power away from our sun for..."
</br></br>
</br>January 24, 2043 </br> Power comes back across the world. Alien population has escaped during The Fourteen Days of Darkness, as it will come to be known. Trace particles indicate an EMP burst originated from the Earth's atmosphere.
</br></br>
</br>January 26, 2043 </br> Alien corpses discovered in alien districts of major cities. No signs show that the wounds were inflicted by humans. 
</br></br>
</br>February 1, 2043 </br> Aliens found hiding in rural communities and city slums. They are the last of the human sympathizers. Most were killed during The Fourteen Days, having been declared heratics.
</br></br>
</br>February 3, 2043 </br> Space probes report a fleet of ships approaching our solar system. Heratics, a name the survivors have taken with pride, confirm the signatures are from USM warships. They will arrive in two months.
</br></br>
</br>February 17, 2043 </br> United Earth Alliance formed as UNE and WUA work to prepare for the USM battle fleet.
</br></br>
</br>February 20, 2043 </br> Heratic scientist present information to UEA defense council. The warships will come and drain the rest of the energy off of the sun, leaving humans and heratics alike to freeze to death. With access to parts from the original crashed ship they should be able to craft a weapon to fight the invading army.
</br></br>
</br>February 22, 2043 </br> UEA appoints team of human and heratic scientists to try and develop weapon.
</br></br>
</br>March 3, 2043 </br> Scientist determine there is enough material to create two weapons, however no viable power source is found.
</br></br>
</br>March 15, 2043 </br> Breakthrough made in finding power source. Machine reacts favorably to Earth's soil. Scientists speculate various soil samples could provide alternate powers to the tower's operation.
</br></br>
</br>March 25, 2043 </br> A system is developed to gather more remains from our battles to construct additional defenses.
</br></br>
</br>March 27, 2043 </br> We've prepared all we can. We have to hope it's enough. We leave tonight. In a week we will meet USM in battle. God help us all if we lose...
